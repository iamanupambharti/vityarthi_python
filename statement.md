# Project Statement – Seat Manager
This project is a simple command-line based Seat Manager System that I made as a part of my Python Projject.  
The main idea is to manage users and seat allocation in a library(self study point) or lab. 

## What the Project Does
- User (with a simple ID and name) creation .
- Shows the list of all users.
- Displays seat status (free or occupied).
- Allows allocating a seat to a user.
- Allows releasing a seat.
- Saves all data in local JSON files so the data stays after closing the program.

## Scope and Limitations
This project is  small and simple because it is made for learning purposes:
- There is no login system or password handling.
- It is designed for around 10–50 seats only.
- Error handling is basic because I am still learning Python.
- The interface is command-line only.

## Why I Chose This Idea
I wanted to build something simple and practical.  
A seat-managing system felt like the right balance between “not too hard” and “useful for learning.”

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.14.0
- JSON for data storage
- Windows terminal / VS Code for running the program

## Personal Note
This is one of my first structured Python projects.
